# README Generator

## Description
This application was designed using node.js, to be able to generate READMEs based off of the user's criteria. It is used by running "node index.js" from the console while in the index.js, and then entering the desired information. A professional README will then be generated after all the info is entered.

 I have learned a lot about Node.js while working on this project.
